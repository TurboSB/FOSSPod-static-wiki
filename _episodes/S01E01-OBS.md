## Episode Notes

> Jim Bailey wanted a way to stream StarCraft – so he wrote his own software to do it. From humble origins, the Open Broadcaster Software has become the de facto standard for streaming video online, and we sat down with Jim to talk about the present and future of OBS, what it’s like maintaining such a critical project, getting your code vetted by NASA, and more.

## Quotes
> ...to be honest, most of the people who have joined the project and have become some of the best contributors are people who are kind of in my same situation. We didn't really know what we were getting into. We didn't really have the experience when we started. And we just kind of learned as we went. Jim Bailey @ 23:30
