## Episode Notes

> Three episodes in, we figured it was about time that we talk over our own origins with open source software, and then ponder the present and (attempt to) predict the future of FOSS for everyday people. Listen on for some reminiscing about Sparcstations, Will's time in a penguin suit, and our earliest tries at using Linux on the desktop, an examination of some previously corporate tech that's now being democratized in open-source form, and more.
