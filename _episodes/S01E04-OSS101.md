## Episode Notes

> By popular request, we're getting as fundamental as we can in this episode with a back-to-basics primer on as many open source concepts as we could come up with, which we hope will lay the groundwork for future episodes. Ever wonder about the difference between a branch and a fork, the ways copyright interacts with code, how open source extends beyond just software, or what makes a Linux distro a Linux distro? This episode is for you!
