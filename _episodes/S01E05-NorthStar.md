## Episode Notes

> We've often said that open source is for more than just software, and on this episode Project North Star's Bryan Chris Brown is here to prove it with a freely available, modifiable design for an augmented reality headset you can build yourself. Join us for a discussion about topics like the ins and outs of open hardware design, sourcing parts from unlikely places, printing lenses out of resin, doing architecture work in the Unreal Engine, how standards like OpenXR fit into the picture, and a whole lot more.
