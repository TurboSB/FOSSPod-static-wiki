## Episode Notes

> Foone Turing regularly performs feats of retro-computing resurrection on Twitter, but convincing Microsoft to release the source code for its classic '90s animation program 3D Movie Maker may be their greatest achievement to date. We sat down with Foone to talk about their plans for expanding 3DMM, asking a big software company to dig through their archives, ancient CompuServe nodes, illicit source-code possession, what's in their forensic data-recovery toolkit, the shocking origin of Comic Sans, and more!
