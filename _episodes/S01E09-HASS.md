## Episode Notes

> Home Assistant is the one-stop shop to control every single smart home and IoT device you own. It's also one of the biggest open source projects around, and for this ep we sat down with its founder Paulus Schoutsen to talk about where the project is at and where it's going, how he's backing an open-source project with a company that generates revenue, the forthcoming Matter standard that will allow devices from all companies to interoperate, building and shipping a piece of hardware during the pandemic, and a bunch more.
