## Episode Notes

> The simple data transfer tool curl, and its associated library, are estimated to be installed on roughly 10 billion computers, VMs, and embedded devices around the world. For this ep we had a wide ranging conversation with Daniel Stenberg, curl's longtime author and maintainer, about starting up such an essential project back in the '90s, juggling the dizzying array of protocols curl supports, the decision-making process around one of the most critical open source programs in use today, and a bunch more.
