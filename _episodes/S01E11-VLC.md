## Episode Notes
```If you're reading this, odds are good you've used VLC before. The most capable video player out there got its start in surprising ways, and on this ep we're joined by project founder Jean-Baptiste Kempf to talk about both VLC's origins and everything else, from '90s MPEG2 decoder hardware to the French Minitel system, the state of modern DRM and upcoming video codecs, VideoLAN's business model, friction with Apple on the App Store, and plenty more.```
