## Episode Notes

> 3D printing has come a long way in a short time, and the open-source web interface OctoPrint has been easing and extending the 3D printing experience for a decade now. On this ep we had a fascinating chat with creator and maintainer Gina Häußge about the project, covering topics like the work that goes into supporting endless printer models, transitioning from being the sole contributor on a project to managing contributors, doing open source work in Europe, why you shouldn't run your Raspberry Pi on an iPhone charger, and lots more.
