## Episode Notes

> Jeremy Allison has been working in open source almost as long as "open source" has existed, largely on the Samba project that facilitates filesharing between Windows and the Unix world. In this ep we chatted with Jeremy not just about where Samba has been and where it's going, but also a wide range of other topics like the Silicon Valley Unix Wars, why it's getting harder to find good C coders, when SMBDirect is coming to the project, aging out of relevance in software development, and more.
