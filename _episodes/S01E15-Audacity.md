## Episode Notes

> The classic open source audio editor Audacity has been around for over two decades, but the Muse Group and product head Martin Keary only came onto the project within the last two years. In this ep we talked to Martin about his extensive background in UX and how he's bringing that expertise to a project as old as Audacity, its recent rapid growth and future roadmap, the bumpy public relations issues that occurred around the Muse Group taking ownership of the project, and more.
