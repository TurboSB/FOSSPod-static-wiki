## Episode Notes

> The MiSTer project is the most exciting thing going in classic video game emulation, and José Tejada Gómez--better known as jotego--is one of the developers at the forefront of this open-source effort to revive dozens of old game consoles and computers. José joins us for a fascinating chat about the ups and downs of programming FPGA chips, balancing his day job as an analog circuit designer, intellectual property in decades-old arcade hardware, using crowd funding to support open source work, the endless debate about emulation versus replication, and plenty more.
