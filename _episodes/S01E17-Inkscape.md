## Episode Notes

> Martin Owens joins us on this episode to talk about the popular open source vector graphics package Inkscape, where he serves as both a developer and a member of the project's leadership committee. Martin shares his perspective on everything from the position of Inkscape in the digital creative market to its exceptionally distributed, consensus-based leadership model, implementing PDF support from scratch, the elusive CMYK support, and a lot more.
