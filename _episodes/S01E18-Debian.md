## Episode Notes

> We couldn't do a podcast about open source without exploring a major Linux distribution, and there's hardly a more influential or enduring distro out there than Debian. So we're delighted to be joined on this episode by the current Debian Project Leader, Jonathan Carter, who spoke with us about a wide range of topics including progress on his goals since taking over the leadership role, why so many other distros are built on Debian, the revolutionary nature of dpkg and apt in the '90s, whether the testing release is appropriate for end users, our shared love of BeOS, what's going to happen when there are no more Toy Story characters, and more.
